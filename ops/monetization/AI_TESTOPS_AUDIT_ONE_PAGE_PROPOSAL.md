# Rajesh Forge — AI TestOps Audit (One-Page Proposal)

## Objective
Identify the fastest path to **higher release confidence** by auditing your QA/TestOps stack across risk, automation reliability, AI controls, and governance.

## What You Get
- Current-state maturity score (10 dimensions)
- Top risk register (business impact prioritized)
- KPI baseline (escape rate, confidence, decision speed, flakiness)
- 30-60-90 day remediation roadmap
- Executive readout + engineering action plan

## Audit Coverage
1. Business-risk alignment
2. Requirements → test traceability
3. Test strategy quality
4. Automation reliability
5. AI-in-testing controls
6. CI/CD quality gates
7. Defect intelligence
8. Observability & confidence metrics
9. Security/compliance/auditability
10. Operating model readiness

## Engagement Options
### Lite (5–7 days) — ₹1.5L to ₹2.5L
Fast diagnostic for one product + one pipeline, with top risks and quick wins.

### Standard (2 weeks) — ₹3L to ₹6L *(recommended)*
Deep-dive audit with roadmap, KPI targets, and dual readout (leadership + engineering).

### Enterprise (3–4 weeks) — ₹8L to ₹15L
Multi-team governance-grade assessment with operating model + board-ready report.

## Typical Outcomes
- Reduced escaped defects in high-risk flows
- Faster go/no-go release decisions
- Lower flaky-test drag in CI
- Better auditability for AI-assisted testing

## Timeline
- Kickoff: 60 min
- Evidence collection + interviews
- Analysis + scoring
- Final report + readout

## Next Step
Reply with:
1) Preferred tier (Lite / Standard / Enterprise)
2) Target product or pipeline
3) Desired kickoff date
