Hi {{Name}} 👋

Quick thought — if your team is doing more AI/automation in QA but still unsure at release time, this could help.

Our **AI TestOps Audit** gives a clear score, top risks, and what to fix first in 30-60-90 days.

Want me to share scope + pricing in one page?

Hi {{Name}},

If release confidence is still subjective, you’re carrying avoidable risk.

Book a **2-week AI TestOps Audit** now — we’ll expose the top failure points, quantify impact, and give an execution plan your team can run immediately.

Reply “audit” and I’ll send the kickoff pack today.

**Subject:** Quick idea to improve release confidence

Hi {{Name}},

Wanted to share something practical: a short **AI TestOps Audit** that shows what’s working, where risk is hiding, and what to fix first.

In ~2 weeks, you get a clear roadmap plus leadership/engineering readout.

Would you like the one-page scope and pricing?

Thanks,
Rajesh

**Subject:** Close release risk gaps in 14 days

Hi {{Name}},

If defect escapes and flaky confidence are slowing releases, waiting costs more than fixing.

Our **AI TestOps Audit** identifies top risk leaks and gives an immediate execution roadmap.

If you can share one product/pipeline today, I can return a kickoff-ready plan this week.

Regards,
Rajesh Forge
