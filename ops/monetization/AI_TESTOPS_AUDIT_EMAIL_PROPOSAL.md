# Email Proposal — AI TestOps Audit

**Subject options:**
1) Proposal: AI TestOps Audit to improve release confidence
2) 2-week AI TestOps diagnostic for {{Company}}
3) Reduce release risk with a structured QA/TestOps audit

Hi {{Name}},

Thank you for the discussion.

Based on your current QA and release goals, I recommend an **AI TestOps Audit** to establish a clear baseline and remediation roadmap.

## What this audit delivers
- Maturity scoring across 10 QA/TestOps dimensions
- Prioritized risk register tied to business impact
- KPI baseline (defect escape, flake-adjusted confidence, release decision speed)
- 30-60-90 day execution roadmap
- Leadership and engineering readout with clear ownership actions

## Engagement options
- **Lite (5–7 days):** ₹1.5L–₹2.5L
- **Standard (2 weeks, recommended):** ₹3L–₹6L
- **Enterprise (3–4 weeks):** ₹8L–₹15L

## Suggested next step
If aligned, please share:
1) preferred tier,
2) target product/pipeline,
3) kickoff window.

I can then send the final statement of work and start plan.

Best regards,
