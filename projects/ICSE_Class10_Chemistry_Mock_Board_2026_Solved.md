### Q2. Fill in the blanks
1. (NH₄)₂SO₄  
2. Quicklime  
3. Carbon dioxide  
4. Oxidation  
5. Hydrated iron(III) oxide (Fe₂O₃·xH₂O)

### Q3. True/False
1. False  
2. True  
3. True  
4. False  
5. True

### Q4. Match the following
(i) NaOH → (b) Caustic soda  
(ii) CaOCl₂ → (a) Bleaching powder preparation  
(iii) H₂SO₄ → (c) Oil of vitriol  
(iv) NH₄OH → (d) Laboratory reagent for alkalis  
(v) Phenolphthalein → (e) Turns pink in base

### Q5. Short answers
1. **Oxidation**: loss of electrons. Example: Zn → Zn²⁺ + 2e⁻  
   **Reduction**: gain of electrons. Example: Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu

2. Balanced equations:  
   (i) 2Mg + O₂ → 2MgO  
   (ii) Zn + H₂SO₄(dil.) → ZnSO₄ + H₂↑

3. Ionic vs Covalent (any two):  
   - Ionic compounds have ions; covalent have molecules.  
   - Ionic compounds conduct electricity in molten/aqueous state; covalent generally do not.  
   - Ionic usually have high m.p./b.p.; covalent generally lower.

4. Conc. H₂SO₄ removes water from compounds (dehydrating agent).  
   Example: C₁₂H₂₂O₁₁ → 12C + 11H₂O (sugar charring in presence of conc. H₂SO₄)

5. **Electroplating**: depositing a thin layer of one metal on another using electrolysis.  
   Uses: chrome plating on car parts, silver plating on cutlery, gold plating on jewelry.

## Section II – Model Answers (Any Four)

### Q6
1. **Acid**: gives H⁺ in water (e.g., HCl).  
   **Base**: gives OH⁻ in water (e.g., NaOH).  
   **Salt**: formed by acid-base neutralization (e.g., NaCl).

2. **pH** is a measure of H⁺ concentration.  
   Acidic: <7, Basic: >7, Neutral: 7.

3. From NaCl:  
   (i) To NaOH (chlor-alkali process):  
   2NaCl + 2H₂O → 2NaOH + Cl₂ + H₂  
   (ii) To HCl gas:  
   NaCl + H₂SO₄(conc.) → NaHSO₄ + HCl↑

### Q7
1. Endothermic absorbs heat; exothermic releases heat.  
   Combination: two/more substances form one product.  
   Decomposition: one substance breaks into simpler substances.

2. Displacement reaction: more reactive metal displaces less reactive metal.  
   Fe + CuSO₄ → FeSO₄ + Cu

3. Ionic equation for neutralization:  
   H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O

### Q8
1. **Metallurgy**: extraction of metals from ores. Steps: concentration, roasting/calcination, reduction, refining.

2. Aluminium is above carbon in reactivity series; Al₂O₃ is very stable, so electrolysis is used.

3. Reasons:  
   (i) Gold is least reactive → occurs native.  
   (ii) Zinc protects iron from rusting (sacrificial protection).  
   (iii) Alloys improve hardness, strength, corrosion resistance.

### Q9
1. Electron dot structures:  
   H₂O: O with two lone pairs and two shared pairs with H.  
   NH₃: N with one lone pair and three shared pairs with H.

2. **Valency**: combining capacity of an atom.  
   **Oxidation number**: apparent charge on atom in a compound.

3. Molecular masses:  
   (i) CaCO₃ = 40 + 12 + (3×16) = 100  
   (ii) H₂SO₄ = (2×1) + 32 + (4×16) = 98

### Q10
1. Names/uses:  
   Ethanol – solvent/fuel; Ethanoic acid – vinegar/preservative;  
   Methane – fuel; Propanone (acetone) – solvent.

2. **Homologous series**: family of compounds with same functional group and general formula; successive members differ by –CH₂–; similar chemical properties; gradation in physical properties.

3. Saturated hydrocarbons: single bonds only (e.g., ethane).  
   Unsaturated hydrocarbons: double/triple bond present (e.g., ethene).
